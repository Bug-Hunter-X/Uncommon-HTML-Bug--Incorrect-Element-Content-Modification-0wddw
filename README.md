# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Element Content Modification

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to modifying the content of HTML elements.  The issue arises from using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when dealing with certain types of content.  `textContent` only sets the plain text content, while `innerHTML` allows you to set the content including HTML tags.  In some cases, using `textContent` may not produce the desired result. 

## Bug Description
The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect way of modifying the content of a div element. The `textContent` property only sets the plain text, ignoring any existing HTML tags. This might lead to unexpected behavior or not changing the content at all, depending on the complexity of the inner content.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file provides the correct implementation, utilizing the `innerHTML` property to accurately set and modify the content within an HTML element. The `innerHTML` property correctly handles HTML tags and other complex content, allowing for a more robust and consistent approach.
